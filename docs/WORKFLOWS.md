# Workflows (Quote → Approval → PO → Delivery)

1) **Quote**: create from BOM pricing → PDF → send to client
2) **Approval**: when accepted, snapshot BOM and lock pricing
3) **PO Split**: create POs by vendor from BOM (via VendorCatalog)
4) **Delivery/Receiving**: record received qty; reconcile costs
5) **Invoice**: (future) auto-generate invoice based on delivery or milestones
